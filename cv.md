3. I am studying at ITMO University in the 3rd year of my bachelors degree, I really want to become a full-stack developer at the end. I have a lot of experience in many fields of programming (as during my studies at university I had to try many things). But right now one of my main goals is to get a job in a good place to work on real projects. Because for now i have decided what i want to do and in which sphere i want to work.
4. I dont want to lie, but it turns out that I studied many programming languages and technologies, but I did not go deep into them. But for example, I have studied: C , C++ , C# , Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, GIT, OOP.

7. I am studying at the third year of a bachelors degree at ITMO University.
8. At university I am in group B2, but the test showed me that I have A2. However, I am good at reading documentation and watching movies in English. This means that I am good in reading and listening. I think I need to improve my grammar a little bit and talk a lot with real people in English and everything will be okay :D
